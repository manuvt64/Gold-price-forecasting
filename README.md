<h1>Gold-Price-forecasting<h1>
  
<h3>In a personal endevaour to learn about time series analysis and forecasting, I decided to reserach and explore various quantitative forecasting methods.This notebook documents contains the methods that can be applied to forecast gold price and model deployment using streamlit, along with a detailed explaination of the different metrics used to evaluate the forecasts.<h3>

<h1>Goal:<h1>
<h3>The goal of this project was to predict future gold price based on previous gold price. I apply various quantitative methods, (i.e. Times Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast the Price of the gold available in the dataset obtained from Kaggle.<h3>

<h1>Models covered in the Project include:<h1>
<h3>1.Naive Model

2.ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Models

3.Linear Regression Model

4.Model Deployment (Streamlit)<h3>
