<h1>Gold-Price-forecasting<h1>
  
<p>In a personal endevaour to learn about time series analysis and forecasting, I decided to reserach and explore various quantitative forecasting methods.This notebook documents contains the methods that can be applied to forecast gold price and model deployment using streamlit, along with a detailed explaination of the different metrics used to evaluate the forecasts.<p>

<h2>Goal:<h2>
The goal of this project was to predict future gold price based on previous gold price. I apply various quantitative methods, (i.e. Times Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast the Price of the gold available in the dataset obtained from Kaggle.

<h2>Models covered in the Project include:<h2>
1.Naive Model

2.ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Models

3.Linear Regression Model

4.Model Deployment (Streamlit)
